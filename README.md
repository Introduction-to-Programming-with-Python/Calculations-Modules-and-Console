# Calculations, Modules and Console

## Statement

This [document](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Programming-with-Python/Calculations-Modules-and-Console/blob/main/statement.pdf) contains the functionality for each file and function.

## Objectives

This project aims to apply the following functionalities:

1. Create and use a module.
2. Build a console based interface to interact with the user.
3. Learn to connect the console interface and modules.
4. Practice calling functions with parameters and calling functions from other functions (function composition).
5. Receive user data by console.
6. Enter the [math library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) for some operations.
7. Practice operators between numbers and strings.

## How does it work?

The file [consola_analisis.py](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Programming-with-Python/Calculations-Modules-and-Console/blob/main/consola_analisis.py) execute the functionality of the file [analisi.py](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Programming-with-Python/Calculations-Modules-and-Console/blob/main/analisis.py) and the file [consola_distancia_puntos.py](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Programming-with-Python/Calculations-Modules-and-Console/blob/main/consola_distancia_puntos.py) execute the functionality of the file [distancia_puntos](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Programming-with-Python/Calculations-Modules-and-Console/blob/main/distancia_puntos.py) interacting with the user with messages, inputs and responses through the console.
